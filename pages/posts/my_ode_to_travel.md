# My Ode to Travel

Growing up, I would often daydream ..

The places that I've never been to,

The people whom I have yet to meet,

The food I have yet to taste,

The culture that I have yet to learn,

The language that I have yet to speak,

And the memories I have yet to experience.
<br></br>
From the plains of Kansas, 

To the foggy skies in San Francisco,

To the towering skyscraper in New York,

To the triumphant monument in France,

To the moist wetland in Canada,

To the bamboo forests in Japan,

To the street of former East Berlin,

And to the cherry blossom in Korea.
<br></br>
We only have one chance at life,

Why not risk it all,

Why not embrace your childhood dream,

Why not go a little further to discover,

Why not learn a little more to appreciate.
<br></br>
We dream of exploring other extraterrestrial planets,

But, for some of us, we have even yet,

to explore our planet.

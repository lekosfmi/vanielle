# Leaving California Pt. 1

There has been a trend recently in the US. I think this trend began before the pandemic. But, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the trend has picked up even more tractions. Several prominent individuals--including Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, and Grahn Stephan, etc.––have announced their departure from California to a state with lower or no income state.  

Famous people aside, several of my friends and former colleagues have also told me that they were moving to Washington, Texas, or Nevada because of the high cost of living and the tax burden they had to pay in California. Therefore, it is not surprising then that I, too, have been thinking about moving my residency away from California.  

I already ran the numbers, did the cost-analysis, and have already reached my conclusion, but let's explore both the benefits and costs together, shall we?

## Climate & Weather:
First, let's talk about the benefit. The most obvious is the infamous California Meditteranean weather. There only a few other places on this Earth that have weather like––southern Italy, Spain, and the western part of Australia. Ironically, I used to complain about the California weather because I had to wear a jacket everywhere I went when I was living in San Francisco. But, after traveling the world and experiencing the climate of over 25+ countries, I concluded that weather does matter, and California has the best weather in the world.

## Geography:
Now, let's say you get sick of the lack of season; well, in California, you are only a few hours car drives away from some of the most magnificent nature. Want snow? Then just go to Tahoe. My friends and I went there several times, and it was beautiful each time. Want to die in scorching in the desert, then go to Death Valley––with a record temperature at 52c and the lowest point of altitude in North America. Want forest? Then how about Muir Woods National Park. The trees grow to as tall as 78m long. 

Anyway, I can keep going on about this. But, the point I am trying to make is that it is very rare to find a place that contains so much nature and wonder despite already possessing one of the best weather systems. Imagine if you are in Seoul, you drive 30min north, and you hit North Korea. If you want to experience the desert, you have to buy an airplane ticket to the Arabian peninsula. Furthermore, say if you live in Kansas and drive 6 hours in any direction, all you get is the prairie and more prairie. And even if you live in New York City, all you have is New Jersey around you.

## Opportunities & Economics:
The first two points are primarily about nature. Now, let's start talking about the artificial benefits. For conservative talk show hosts, one of their favorite activities is mocking and criticising California. But, if you take a few steps back and look at the big picture, much of their criticism immediately falls apart. I think most Americans (who are not Californians) underestimate the scale of both California's economy and population. 

For the economy, California's GDP is $2.46trillion. On a global scale, only Germany, Japan, China, and the US surpassed California. Therefore, if California were a country, it would firmly be in the top ten OECD countries. 

As for population, California has a population have 40 million people. Despite the number of people leaving, California's population has experienced an increase thanks to immigration. On the other hand, Canada's population is only 37 million. California, a single state among 50, has more people residing in it than Canada's entire country. 

Macroeconomics is excellent, but how does that translate to you and me as an individual? Opportunities. If your career is in technology and entertainment, California is a no-brainer for obvious reasons.

## Cuisine, Culture, & Travel:
Finally, let's talk about other points that may matter a lot to me and less to other people. California is on the west coast and has an international airport. This is important considering how much I love to travel to Korea and Japan. It is worth it (for me) not to pay extra dollars and not take a connecting flight. 

Another thing is ethnic Asian food that is not a panda express or an oily Chinese takeout that served mainly non-Asian people. The main issue with ethnic food is that if you want good ethnic food, you can't get them in a place like Wyoming. Or, at the very least, it is challenging. Most of the Chinese restaurants in that area will gear their food towards serving a non-Asian populace. So for me, living anywhere in middle America, deep-south, Alaska, or the likes of Idaho and Montana is off the list. 

This essay has dragged on long enough. In the following essay, I will be discussing the reasons for leaving California.

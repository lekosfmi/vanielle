# The Storming of the US Capitol

Ever since I was young, I was an avid reader of history. Specifically, the Vietnam War, but other similar wars like the Korean War, the Chilean Coup d'etat also garnered my attention.

"All of these events and more have one commonality..." I thought as my fingers rifled through the decadent pages of the history books. 

In regards to the Vietnam War, after the French had withdrawn their troops, a special election was expected to be held shortly.

But, it was never the case. With support from Mao's China, the Northern Vietnamese troops led a march across the military division. Instead of an election, both North and South Vietnam found themselves in a power struggle that lasted 25 years, which is nearly a quarter of one's lifetime.

Had both sides have mutual respect for one another and the respect for a democratic and fair election, it could have spared many lives.
・・・
Reading the history and power struggle of those foreign nations and the countless coup d'etat made me realised how fortunate I was to be an American.

If we developed a distaste for our elected leaders, then we can choose every 2 or 4 years to cast our ballots for an entirely new set of leaders to represent us. In short, the shedding of blood was unnecessary.

Then, it happened.

For the first time since the Great Depression and the 1932 election between incumbent Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party had a trifecta victory against the incumbent 45th president.

The margins were closed in some cases, but it solidifies our current 45th president as a "one-termer." The 45th president also became the 6th president in US history to have a trifecta loss––including the presidency and both chambers of Congress.

Angry and delusional with the result, the 45th president continued to rouse his supporters. So on 2020/01/06, a group of disorganised followers of the 45th President––inspired wrongfully by his obnoxious rhetoric––stormed into the capitol building. They ransacked halls, broke windows, and destroyed government property. Five people lost their lives. For a moment in time, the once known safest haven was no longer safe. And for a moment in time, we Americans reflected and questioned our democratic institution.

News media outlets around the world were either shocked or had their beliefs affirmed. As Americans, we like to lecture others on the values of a  just democratic institution. But for a brief moment, we were unable to walk the talk of our tongue. There was now a death toll associated with what could have been a triumphant and bloodless election.

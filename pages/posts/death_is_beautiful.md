# Death is Beautiful

One of the things that I hate the most is saying bye. Of course, saying "bye" is necessary, but I still find myself at odds with it. 

The first time that I said "bye" was to my childhood home. Though it has been more than 20 years, I miss it dearly. I missed the crowded stamping street, the bustling markets, the busy caf√© lusted with the smell of French roast coffee, and even the rancid smell of cigarettes intertwined with the monsoon evening rained. Often, when I feel nostalgic, I might close my eyes and turned on their music to trigger my memories. Or listen to their language thoughtlessly. 

The great thing about missing a place is that if your heart yearns for it, then you can always come back to visit it. 

But, what about people? What if you miss someone? And, if you can't see them again even though your wishes desire it? 

When I was nine years old, I sat on a chair in the waiting room at the hospital. It was in the afternoon, and I had just gotten out of school. After my mom picks me from school, we would always drive straight home. However, that day I could tell something was different. My older step-brother had also come with my mom; and, we were all waiting in the waiting room together. The atmosphere was tensed. I didn't know why it was so tensed. 

That was, of course, until a doctor pulled open the door and entered the room where we were waiting. Both my mom and my older step-brother tugged at the doctor for news, but the doctor then took a deep breath with a worried expression. It was one of the news that every medical student dread at one day telling their patients' loved ones: "He has passed."

Within just that second, my older brothers have lost their beloved father, my mom, at the mere age of 37, have become a widow, and I got to known death at a tragic first glance.

Death is beautiful. It is the one thing in this world that reminds you that you are a mortal. That behind the veil of everyday life, your time is finite. We may not like to think about it. Or, be reminded of its unforgiven nature, but it will always be there to greet you. 

So on that very night and the following days, I had to visit the funeral halls frequently. Child me got to see the father figure that I once saw daily, laying calmly and static in the bedded coffin. 

Unlike missing my old childhood home, this was tragic, sad, and permanent. Sad and tragic because my step-father had died at not even 59 years of age. Permanent because time will always move forward, closer to death heels, and never further from it. 

Fast-forward to the present day, and the dread of saying "bye" to someone has never gotten easier. One of which hits closer to home than I expected. 

Summer of last year, I received news of one of my childhood friends passing away. We haven't been in touch for years. However, I still fondly remember childhood memories of hanging out with her, especially when we attended Sunday school together. Hearing the news about her sudden passing triggered my memories and made me sobered. For me, the true tragedy of her passing was that she was only a single age older than me.
Her death reminds me that our age is only a mere promised of our youth and vivaciousness but not a guarantee of our continual existence. 

Since I was 9, I have asked myself: "If I were to cease to exist tomorrow, is what I am doing now...am I going to regret it on my deathbed?" If I end up answering "yes" to this question for too many days or weeks in a row, then I knew that I had to reset and revitalised my goals and dreams.

This has affected my decisions from deciding to move pivot from a career in law and politics to one in technology and innovation, from a life in prairie fields of Oklahoma to a life in the bustling city of San Francisco, from a lucrative six-figure job in Silicon Valley to being nearly broke in order to fulfill my dream of traveling the world, and sway away from offers at a top-tier technology company to helping to co-found a current startup.

All of this is so that one day when my footstep drops closer to death's doorstep, I can remind myself that "at least I can feather no more regrets having lived this life."
